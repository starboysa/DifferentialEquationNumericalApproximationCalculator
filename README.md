# Differential Equation Numerical Approximation Calculator

# About
A somewhat featured calculator language that is used to run Numerical Approximation on a first order ODE using:
* Euler Method
* Improved Euler Method
* Runge Kutta (4)

# Usage
Type in y', t0, y0, and tEnd to start testing different step sizes.

Notes on equation input:
Currently supports:
* Decimal Numbers
* Grouping
* Algebra          (+ - * /)
* Power            (^)
* Sqrt             (sqrt() or $())
* Trig functions   (sin cos tan)
* Euler's Constant (e)

If input breaks try the following:
* Fill in implicit operators (i.e 3t -> 3 * t)
* Group powers (e^(t/2)sin(5t) = sin(t2) * e^(t/2))

To safely close the application: purposefully put in bad input until given the option to exit the application.
